# Introduction

OpenHDL-Core is an open, modular, and extensible hardware design core library.

It aims to provide a unified and reusable foundation for digital hardware development, covering a wide spectrum of hardware building blocks across different abstraction levels and design domains. Rather than focusing on a specific category of components, the project is intended to serve as a long-term, evolving foundation for diverse hardware systems.

The project is not limited to a particular hardware description language, implementation style, or fixed set of modules. As new components, architectures, and design methodologies emerge, OpenHDL-Core is designed to grow and adapt accordingly.

Emphasizing modularity, clarity, and long-term maintainability, OpenHDL-Core is designed to support scalable and sustainable hardware system development.

# Project Philosophy

OpenHDL-Core is built around a set of design principles that prioritize long-term usability, clarity, and evolution over short-term completeness.

## Modularity First

All designs are structured as independent and self-contained modules with well-defined interfaces. Each module should be reusable in different contexts without relying on implicit assumptions about the surrounding system.

## Clarity over Cleverness

Readability and explicitness are preferred over overly compact or obscure implementations. The code should be easy to understand, review, and maintain, even by developers who are not the original authors.

## Reusability as a Core Goal

Modules are designed to serve as general-purpose building blocks rather than project-specific solutions. Flexibility and composability are favored over narrow, highly specialized implementations.

## Language and Methodology Agnostic

The project does not enforce a single hardware description language or design methodology. Any language or approach suitable for digital hardware design is acceptable, as long as it adheres to the overall project philosophy.

## Evolution-Oriented Design

OpenHDL-Core is expected to grow and evolve over time. Architectural consistency and clean abstractions are valued more than having a complete feature set at any given moment.
